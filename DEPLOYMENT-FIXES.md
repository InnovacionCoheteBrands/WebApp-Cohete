# Deployment Configuration Fixed

## Issues Resolved

The deployment was previously blocked due to security risks from using development commands in production. The following fixes have been applied:

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Production Build Command**: Updated to use `node production-build.js` instead of `npm run build`
2. **Production Start Command**: Application now uses `npm start` which runs `NODE_ENV=production node index.js`
3. **Dependency Bundling**: All dependencies (cors, express, drizzle-orm, etc.) are now bundled into a single 20MB file
4. **Module Format**: Fixed ESM compatibility issues with proper module configuration

### ✅ Deployment Configuration

- **Build Command**: `node production-build.js`
- **Run Command**: `npm start` (production mode)
- **Bundle Output**: `dist/index.js` (20.1MB with all dependencies)
- **External Dependencies**: Only native modules (pg-native, bufferutil, etc.)

### ✅ Verification

The production server has been tested and confirmed working:
- Health endpoint responds correctly
- All dependencies properly bundled
- No missing package errors
- Ready for deployment

## Summary

The deployment is now ready and will no longer be blocked by security restrictions. The application uses proper production commands and has all dependencies bundled for reliable deployment.
