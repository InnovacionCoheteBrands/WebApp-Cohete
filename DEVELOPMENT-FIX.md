# Development Environment Fix for Cohete Workflow

## Problem Analysis

The application is failing to start because:

1. **Missing dev script**: The package.json only has production scripts (`start`, `debug`) but the workflow expects `npm run dev`
2. **Development/Production mismatch**: The codebase has development dependencies installed but the package.json is configured for production
3. **Dependency conflicts**: Multiple version conflicts between packages (zod v3 vs v4, ws vs utf-8-validate, etc.)
4. **Vite configuration issues**: Top-level await in vite.config.ts causing CJS compatibility problems

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Working Development Server
- **Location**: `scripts/dev.js`
- **Purpose**: Bypass dependency conflicts and provide basic server functionality
- **Features**: 
  - Express server with CORS
  - Health check endpoints
  - Static file serving
  - Basic API endpoints

### 2. Development Environment Scripts
- **dev-fix.js**: Main development launcher
- **run-dev.js**: Alternative development script
- **simple-server.js**: Minimal Express server for testing

### 3. Temporary WebSocket Disabled
- Commented out WebSocket imports in `server/grok-integration.ts` and `server/routes.ts`
- This resolves the `ws` dependency conflicts

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Dependencies**: 
- Core packages installed: express, cors, tsx, typescript, react, react-dom, vite
- Authentication packages: passport, passport-local, passport-google-oauth20, express-session, bcryptjs
- Database packages: pg, drizzle-orm, drizzle-zod, zod@3.25.1
- Development packages: @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom

❌ **Remaining Issues**:
- WebSocket functionality temporarily disabled (ws dependency conflicts)
- Vite configuration has top-level await causing CJS compatibility issues
- Full TypeScript server compilation failing due to import path issues

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fix**: Use the working development server in `scripts/dev.js`
2. **Workflow Fix**: Create a proper dev script or modify workflow to use existing scripts
3. **Full Restoration**: Resolve dependency conflicts and restore full functionality

## How to Run Development Server

```bash
# Option 1: Use the development fix
node dev-fix.js

# Option 2: Run development server directly
node scripts/dev.js

# Option 3: Use the simple server
node simple-server.js
```

## Environment Access

Once running, the development server will be available at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health
- **API Health**: http://localhost:5000/api/health
