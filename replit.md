## Changelog
- July 15, 2025. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FIXED - Resolved major development environment issues caused by missing npm run dev script. Created working development server (start-dev.js) that bypasses dependency conflicts and provides functional development environment. Fixed package.json mismatch between production configuration and development workflow expectations. Created multiple development server alternatives (scripts/dev.js, dev-fix.js) to ensure development continuity.
- July 15, 2025. DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE.JSON FIXES - Fixed deployment failures caused by missing package.json in root directory. Updated all build scripts (final-deployment.js, deploy-build.js, production-deploy.js, simple-deploy.js) to create package.json in both dist and root directories. Modified start commands to run from workspace root instead of requiring 'cd dist'. All deployment scripts now use 'npm install && npm start' instead of 'cd dist && npm install && npm start'.
- July 14, 2025. COMPLETE PROJECT DATA INTEGRATION - Updated AI calendar generation to utilize ALL project data fields from the "New Project" form. Enhanced AI prompt to specifically consider: communicationObjectives, buyerPersona, archetypes, marketingStrategies, brandCommunicationStyle, mission/vision/coreValues, response policies, and initialProducts.
